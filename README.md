- 👋 Hi, I’m @MartynL - or just Martyn :D <br> I've been a developer for about 5 years now working for a small company where 
     I've been exposed to pretty much all stages of the software lifecycle. I work mostly with Java, using Spring Framework / Spring Boot, along with SQL and HTML/CSS/Javascipt
     but I enjoy playing with other languages when I get the chance to. I've built CI/CD pipelines in Azure devops and had some exposure to AWS which I hope to expand on as much as I can.
     My goal is to become a Software Architect when I feel I've got enough experience to do so.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in all its forms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about:
  <ul>
      <li>The Spring eco-system and about using it in the cloud with AWS.</li>
      <li>Learning more about the different aspects of Systsm Architecture and integrations.</li> 
      <li>Learning more about different technologies that can be implemented and how they interact with other services.</li>
      <li>Basically, everything I can get my hands on because the more I learn, the more I realise how much more there is to go. Just gotta go one step at a time!</li>
  </ul>
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on absolutely anything. I'm quite happy to develop and increase my skills with any project - or hell, any language (though this might involve a lot of google-fu haha) - if I have the time to do so.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can fire me a message to my email at mlatta1990@hotmail.co.uk
